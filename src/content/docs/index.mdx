## Why Drakai?

Drakai was created to bridge the gap between cryptographic theory and practical implementation for developers. Most cryptography resources are either too abstract or too academic. The goal of this project is to

- **Developer-focused content** with practical code samples in Go and Node.js
- **Simple explanations** for complex concepts like elliptic curves and zero-knowledge proofs
- **Real-world relevance** for blockchain, secure messaging, and web authentication
- **Community-driven contributions** to keep the knowledge base evolving

Whether you're working on a blockchain technology or just want to understand how encryption, SSH, TSL works under the hood like me, this project is your starting point.
