Hi guys, This is <a href="https://github.com/codeshaine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
codeshaine
</a> (for now). If have visited this page then I would assume you might be thinking of contributing to this project. If yes, then go ahead do a PR, I will merge it.

Well I won't include any restriction on contributing but keep in mind that, This site is made for developers to understand cryptography related stuff, it would be better if you add content by yourself, without pasting AI slop. though you can generate programming example either in Golang or Typescript(if you have an other lanugage in mind then contact me ahead) with AI but do explain it well.
